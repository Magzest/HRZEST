# ── Per-test database isolation ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# The suite previously shared one persistent att_test database across every
# test with no reset between tests -- rows (and mutated config: several
# tests POST to /settings and never revert it) leaked from one test into the
# next, making the *number* of failures depend on run order: 256 failures
# running the whole suite in one process vs. 124 running the same tests
# split into two, with individual failures passing when run alone (see the
# audit). Fixed below by snapshotting every table's full row contents right
# after one-time baseline setup finishes, then restoring that exact
# snapshot after every single test, pass or fail.
#
# Deliberately NOT done by wrapping each test in one shared connection/
# transaction that rolls back at teardown (the other standard approach for
# this kind of problem): this app has both a real background writer thread
# (utils/async_writer.py, started unconditionally at import -- neutralized
# for tests above via set_synchronous_mode, which was needed for this
# reason regardless of which approach was used) AND a genuine multi-thread
# concurrency test (test_seats.py's
# test_concurrent_signups_at_cap_only_one_succeeds, which spawns two real
# threads racing two independent real connections against a row lock to
# prove only one wins). Forcing every get_db_connection() call during a
# test onto one shared connection would break that test outright and would
# need permanent special-casing for every future concurrency test. Snapshot/
# restore instead leaves the app's normal connection pooling completely
# untouched -- every test still gets real, independent, autocommit
# connections exactly as production does; only the *starting data* is reset.
