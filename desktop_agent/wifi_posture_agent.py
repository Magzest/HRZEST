"""Windows Wi-Fi/network posture agent for HRzest.com.

WHY THIS EXISTS: a browser page cannot read Wi-Fi encryption type, ARP
tables, or DNS configuration — those aren't exposed to page JavaScript by
any browser, on any OS, ever (it's a sandbox boundary, not a missing
library). The only place that data is genuinely available is the OS itself.
This script runs as a small background service ON THE EMPLOYEE'S MACHINE,
reads real OS-level signals via netsh/arp/ipconfig, computes a 0-100 risk
score, and serves it on the loopback interface ONLY (127.0.0.1 — never the
network) at GET /risk. The employee portal page
(templates/employee_portal.html's "DEVICE POSTURE RELAY" script) polls that
URL from the browser tab, using ITS OWN authenticated session, and relays
the score to POST /api/employee/device_risk (blueprints/employee_portal.py)
— which is what actually blocks the UI and terminates the session once the
score exceeds 60. This agent has no credentials, sees no session cookie,
and cannot itself talk to the backend — it only ever answers a localhost
query with a number and a list of threat-vector labels.

Platform: Windows only (netsh/arp/ipconfig are Windows commands). There is
no equivalent for a plain web page on macOS/Linux either, for the same
sandboxing reason — the same "small local agent" pattern would need
platform-specific system calls (e.g. `iwconfig`/`nmcli` + `ip neigh` on
Linux, `airport`/`arp` on macOS) if this is ever extended past Windows.
Mobile is a separate, weaker story: iOS exposes essentially none of this to
any app, sandboxed or not. Android exposes SSID/BSSID/encryption type to a
native app via WifiManager (with location permission, since SSID counts as
location data) but not ARP tables — a React Native module could report
encryption weakness, not spoofing, on Android; nothing meaningful on iOS.

Deploy as a scheduled task at logon (run once, not as a click-to-launch
app — a security agent an employee can just close defeats the point):
