        # accept loop -- BEFORE it spawns the per-connection worker thread.
        # threaded=True only threads request *handling*; it can't thread
        # the handshake, because the handshake happens a step earlier, in

        # A client that completes the TCP connect but stalls or never

        # call blocked forever waiting for handshake bytes that never
        # arrive. With the loop itself wedged, the server stops accepting
        # *any* new connection -- reproduced locally as: server process
        # alive and CPU-idle, but every new request (even `curl`) times
        # out during the TLS ClientHello, confirmed via a `sample` stack

        # visitor's browser still sees a stall (or ERR_TIMED_OUT, if its
        # own timeout is shorter) until that expires. This version removes
        # the freeze entirely: the listening socket is left unwrapped (a
        # plain accept() never blocks on a handshake), and the TLS wrap +
        # handshake is deferred into finish_request(), which
        # ThreadingMixIn always runs inside the freshly spawned
        # per-connection worker thread -- so a stalled handshake only ever
        # ties up its own disposable thread, never the shared accept loop.
