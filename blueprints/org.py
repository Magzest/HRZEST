    _validate_new_tenant_fields() first -- this only does the actual
    provisioning, which is where the three call sites would otherwise
    duplicate ~80 near-identical lines.

    admin_password_hash is an ALREADY-HASHED password (bcrypt, via
    utils/auth.py's generate_password_hash()) -- this function used to
    accept and hash the plaintext itself, but callers now hash one level
    up. That's because the gated signup flow (blueprints/org.py's
    /create_org*) stores the application in tenant_applications for a
    possibly multi-day pending-review window before provision_tenant() is
    ever called, and the password must never sit there in plaintext.

    payment_option is a record of how the tenant is billed ("online" via
    Razorpay, "manual" bank-transfer/invoice, or "trial") -- it doesn't
    trigger any charge itself, that already happened (or didn't, for
    "manual"/"trial") before this function is called.

    email_domain (e.g. "acme.com") is stored on the new tenant's own
    company_settings row -- utils/helpers.py's validate_employee_email_domain()
    reads it from there to require/check new employees' emails going forward.

    logo_path is a relative static/ path (e.g. "company_logos/acme.png",
    as returned by utils/helpers.py's save_uploaded_logo()) for the
    company logo collected on the registration form -- written to
    company_settings.logo_url so it's already in place the first time
    anyone (employee, admin, or HR) opens a dashboard. None/omitted means
    no logo was uploaded at signup; the default "no logo" rendering
    (templates already fall back to a generic building icon) applies.

    employee_count is the number of seats actually paid for -- written to
    company_settings.paid_employee_slots (a column that already existed in
    the schema migrations but was never populated or enforced anywhere;
    see utils/helpers.py's add_employee_seat_cap_check() for where it's
    checked). None means unlimited -- used by the free/unmetered callers
    (the local-dev fallback POST /create_org, the mobile app's own
    /api/create_org registration flow, and Platform Admin's own tenant
    creation), which intentionally don't gate on payment.

    Returns (ok, error_message_or_None, portal_url_or_None, checkin_url_or_None).
