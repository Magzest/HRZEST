"""Trial-to-paid conversion -- the daily jobs that watch a tenant's free
trial (blueprints/org.py's create_org_setup_trial_confirm(), which sets
tenants.subscription_status='trialing' at trial signup; trial_start_date/
trial_end_date are left NULL until first login -- see app.py's
inject_billing_lock_status()) and hand it off to the ordinary billing
machinery every other tenant already uses once it ends.

Distinct from blueprints/auto_debit.py (the recurring engine itself) and
blueprints/billing_dunning.py (the grace/lock cycle for a missed bill) --
this module only owns the trial-specific timeline: the "ending soon"
reminder and the one-time "trial is over" conversion. Once a trial
converts, it becomes an indistinguishable auto_debit_mandates subscriber,
and (since payment_option is flipped to 'online' below) comes under
billing_dunning.py's daily cron for every bill after that -- no separate
trial-specific dunning path is needed.
