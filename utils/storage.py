"""Upload storage abstraction -- local disk today, S3-ready without a
behavior change until you actually opt in.

Why this exists: every upload path in this codebase (company logos,
employee documents, KYC application documents, ID-card photos/QR codes)
writes straight to the local filesystem under static/ or private_uploads/.
That's fine for a single dev/EC2-instance deployment, but breaks the
moment this runs as more than one container/instance (nothing shared
between them) or behind ephemeral container storage (a restart silently
loses every upload since the last deploy).

This module is a drop-in save/read/delete/url layer that:
  - Uses S3 when AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID + AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (or an IAM
    role -- boto3's default credential chain either way) AND S3_BUCKET
    are configured.
  - Falls back to the exact same local-disk behavior as before when
    they're not -- this is the ONLY mode actually exercised today, since
    no deployment has S3 configured yet. Local dev and the current
    production EC2 instance are both completely unaffected until someone
    sets S3_BUCKET.

boto3 is imported lazily, only inside the S3 code path (never at module
import time) -- same pattern utils/secrets_loader.py already uses for AWS
Secrets Manager, so a local dev environment that has never run `pip
install boto3` (it's in requirements.txt for production, not necessarily
installed in every dev venv) still works fine as long as S3 isn't
configured.

Callers, not this module, decide public vs. private:
  - save_public(): local path is under static/ (Flask serves it
    directly); S3 path uploads with public-read-equivalent access
    (bucket policy, not ACLs -- ACLs are deprecated/often disabled on
    newer buckets) and returns a direct object URL. For company
    logos, QR codes -- anything already safe to be world-readable today.
  - save_private(): local path is OUTSIDE static/ (mirrors
    utils/helpers.py's save_application_document() convention); S3 path
    uploads to the same bucket but the URL returned is None -- callers
    must use open_private()/a presigned URL, never a bare object URL,
    for anything that needs an auth check first (employee documents, KYC
    application documents).

Wired in today: utils/helpers.py's save_uploaded_logo() (public) and
save_application_document() (private) -- the two centralized,
single-purpose upload helpers already existed as one call site each,
making them the safe, low-risk first integration point. The remaining
scattered inline os.path.join(...).save(...) call sites (employee ID
photos/QR codes in blueprints/employees.py, employee_docs in
blueprints/documents.py, kiosk face-log photos in
blueprints/employee_portal.py) still write directly to local disk --
migrating those needs their matching read-back call sites (send_file,
send_from_directory, direct Image.open()) updated in the same pass, a
larger and riskier change to make blind without live S3 credentials to
verify against. Follow-up, not done here.
