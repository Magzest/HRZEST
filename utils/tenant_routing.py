"""Path-based multi-tenancy: WSGI-level prefix stripping.

Replaces the old subdomain scheme (acme.hrzest.com) with a URL-path scheme
(www.hrzest.com/acme/...). This has to happen at the WSGI layer, before
Flask's router ever sees the request, rather than by adding a
"<company_slug>" route parameter to every one of the ~300 existing routes:
app.py's before/after_request hooks do exact/prefix matches on
request.path in ~18 places (Turnstile CAPTCHA gating, the WiFi-posture-
agent CSP carve-out, healthz/static/api exemptions, CSRF login-route
exemption) and all of those would silently break if request.path suddenly
carried a tenant prefix everywhere. Stripping the slug into SCRIPT_NAME
here means every one of those checks, and every existing route decorator,
keeps seeing exactly the bare path it sees today -- "/admin_login", not
"/acme/admin_login".

RESERVED_PATH_SEGMENTS is the single source of truth for "is this first
path segment a real top-level route, or a company slug" -- both this
middleware and blueprints/org.py's subdomain-format validation import it
from here, so a new top-level route only needs to be added to one place.
