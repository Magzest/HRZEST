    SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT (extensions.py, currently 1 hour) -- or

    the hardcoded TRIAL_EMPLOYEE_CAP for a tenant mid-trial, or otherwise
    company_settings.paid_employee_slots (the seat count actually paid for
    at signup via blueprints/billing.py's payment-verified flow). Both
    checks live in this one function (rather than a separate
    _get_trial_employee_cap_error()) so there's exactly one COUNT(*) and
    one lock acquisition per call, not one per cap type. A slots value of
    None means unlimited: the free/unmetered provisioning paths
    (local-dev fallback, mobile app registration, Platform Admin's own
    tenant creation) never set this column, and existing tenants
    provisioned before this check existed also have it unset, so this
    never blocks them -- unless they're also mid-trial, which still
    applies TRIAL_EMPLOYEE_CAP regardless. Returns an error message ready
    to flash/return as-is, or None if there's room.

    Pass the caller's own open cursor -- the same one it will use for the
    employee INSERT right after this returns None -- to make the cap
    race-safe, AND wrap both this call and that INSERT in
    `with database.transaction(db):`. The transaction() part is not
    optional: database.py's connection pool hands out connections with
    autocommit=True (_borrow_connection()), so on a bare cursor (no
    explicit transaction) the row lock this takes below would release
    itself the instant its own SELECT statement finished -- a full
    statement earlier than the INSERT it's supposed to still be
    protecting -- and the race would be exactly as open as if no cursor
    had been passed at all. With a real transaction, and only when
    there's an actual cap to enforce (trialing, or paid_employee_slots is
    not None), this takes a row lock on company_settings FIRST (the one
    tenant-wide settings row), before counting employees, so a second
    concurrent caller blocks here until the first either commits its
    INSERT (and this recount then correctly sees it, and rejects) or
    rolls back (and this recount doesn't see it, so a slot is still
    free). That's what actually closes the classic check-then-insert
    TOCTOU race: two requests both reading COUNT()==cap-1 before either
    has inserted, and both proceeding. Unlimited, non-trial tenants skip
    the lock entirely -- there's no cap to protect, so there's no reason
    to serialize their employee creation.

    Called with no cursor (own short-lived, read-only connection,
    released immediately, no lock taken) is NOT race-safe by itself --
    it's kept only for a cheap early/UX preflight (e.g. rejecting before
    an expensive face-photo upload), not as the actual enforcement point.
    Every call site must also perform the cursor-and-transaction-carrying,
    lock-protected call immediately before its INSERT for the cap to
    actually hold under concurrency -- see blueprints/employees.py's
    add_employee_page()/api_register_employee() and blueprints/core.py's
    api_employee_signup() for the pattern.
