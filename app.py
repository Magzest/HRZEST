# ---------------- AUDIT LOGGING ----------------
# (Consolidated onto utils/helpers.py -- see import block above.)

# ---------------- FILE UPLOAD VALIDATION ----------------
# (Consolidated onto utils/helpers.py -- see the import block above. app.py
# used to carry its own duplicate of _scan_for_malware/_validate_upload/
# _validate_image_file, which meant the security-event logging added to
# the utils/helpers.py versions never reached any of app.py's 10 real
# upload call sites. Same bug class as the auth-decorator duplication
# fixed earlier this session, found the same way: by checking whether an
# edited function's call sites actually resolved to the edited copy.)

# ---------------- COMPANY SETTINGS (with 60-second TTL cache) ----------------
# Consolidated onto utils/helpers.py -- app.py used to carry its own
# separate _co_cache/_auth_cache dicts. Both copies were logically
# identical, but being separate meant a settings change saved through
# app.py's real routes (which call app.py's own invalidate_settings_cache())
# would never clear a cache a future blueprint read through
# utils.helpers.get_company_settings() -- up to 60 seconds of serving a
# stale company name/logo/setup_done flag to any code path using the
# other copy. One cache now, so one invalidation reaches everyone.

# _VALID_CFS_COLS / _upsert_co_feature / _upsert_co_features consolidated
# onto utils/helpers.py (see import block near the top of this file) -- that
# copy double-gates column names (frozenset membership + identifier regex)
# where this one only checked the frozenset. Not independently exploitable
# on its own (the frozenset is an exact-match allowlist, not a pattern, so
# nothing outside the 19 known-safe column names could ever reach the
# f-string SQL below either way) but the two copies had also drifted
# functionally: this file's allowlist had 5 columns
# (shift_start/shift_half/shift_end/holiday_pay/leave_pay) that the
# utils/helpers.py copy was missing, since added there to match.
